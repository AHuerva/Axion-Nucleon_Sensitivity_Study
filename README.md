# Axion-Nucleon Sensitivity Study

This repository contains a research project aimed at evaluating the sensitivity of the IAXO detector to various axion spectra, with a particular focus on axion-nucleon coupling. To this end, two complementary studies were conducted:

## 1. Efficiency Study

Simulations were performed to estimate the detectorâ€™s efficiency under different configurations, including variations in pressure, drift distance, and gas composition. All necessary files and instructions to reproduce this study can be found in the corresponding folder.

## 2. Background Study

To complete the sensitivity analysis, a second study was carried out to evaluate the impact of background levels for the same set of configurations. As with the previous study, all relevant files and reproduction instructions are provided in the corresponding folder.

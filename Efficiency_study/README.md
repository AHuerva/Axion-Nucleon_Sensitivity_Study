# Efficiency Study

This efficiency study is part of a research project focused on evaluating the detector's performance using different drift chambers and gas mixtures.

## Installation

Once REST-for-Physics is installed, there is no need to install any additional software. Simply download the contents of this GitHub repository, and it is ready for use.


## Intrinsic Efficiency

The aim of these simulations is to determine the detector's intrinsic efficiency in the 0–16 keV energy range, with 0.25 keV intervals. To run these simulations, execute `launchSim2.sh`. This will generate several output files, which can be analyzed using `getEfficiency.C` located in the `simFiles_Henke` directory. The result will be a file containing the calculated efficiency for each energy.


  ### Example of use

To run a simulation, open `launchSim2.sh` and edit it with the desired parameters. Example:

```bash

#!/bin/bash
#set -x
for N in $(seq 0.25 0.25 16.0)
do
  export GEOMETRY=Chamber_6cm.gdml
  export GAS_VOLUME=XenonNeon2.3%Isobutane2.0bar 
  export PRESSURE=2.0
  export NAME=Henke
  export POSITION=33.5
  export ENERGY="$N"

  restG4 Isotopes_Xe_fluxes.rml -e 10000
done


```
Then, execute the script.

```bash

./launchSim2.sh

```


Explanation of parameters:

The line `for N in $(seq 0.25 0.25 16.0)` defines a loop that starts at 0.25 keV and increments by 0.25 keV, ending at 16 keV.

`GEOMETRY` specifies the geometry file (e.g., 6 cm drift chamber)

`GAS_VOLUME` defines the gas mixture used (must match an entry in `Chamber_6cm.gdml`)

`PRESSURE` must match the pressure in `GAS_VOLUME`

Setting `NAME` = Henke directs the output files to the corresponding directory.

`POSITION` is optional to change, but `ENERGY` must remain fixed.

`-e 10000` sets the number of detected events in the Micromegas to 10000.

`Isotopes_Xe_fluxes.rml` corresponds to the detector filled with the xenon mixture. To use the argon mixture instead, it should be replaced with `Isotopes_Ar_fluxes.rml`

---------------------------------------------------------

Once the simulations have finished, they can be analyzed by executing `getEfficiency.C` within restRoot. Example:

```bash

restRoot

```

```bash

.x getEfficiency.C("RestG4_run*_2.0bar_Henke_XeNeISO_6cmDrift_v2.4.3")

```

This command will analyze all files whose names match the given pattern, where * acts as a wildcard.

## Nominal fluxes

The purpose of this study is to determine the detector's efficiency for different axion spectra: axion-photon, axion-electron and axion-nucleon, which can be found in the `histograms` directory. To run these simulations, execute `launchSim.sh`. This will generate one output file per simulation, which can be analyzed using the appropriate `GetEfficiency.C` script located in the corresponding directory (e.g. `simFiles_aN`). 

The result can either be a ROOT histogram representing the detected flux (e.g. when using `GetBinEfficiencyaN.C`), which can be compared to the original flux, or the calculated detection effiency (e.g. when using `GetEfficiencyaN.C`).

### Example of use

To run a simulation, open `launchSim.sh` and edit it with the desired parameters. Example:

```bash

export NAME=aN 
export RANGE="(0,16)"
export POSITION=33.5   
export GEOMETRY=Chamber_3cm.gdml 
export GAS_VOLUME=XenonNeon2.3%Isobutane2.0bar 
export PRESSURE=2.0

restG4 -j 4 Isotopes_Xe_fluxes.rml -e 200000 


```
Then, execute the script.

```bash

./launchSim.sh

```


Explanation of parameters:


`NAME` refers to the corresponding axion spectra, so that the ROOT file is generated in the appropriate directory (in this case `simFiles_aN`).

`RANGE` is the energy range in keV.

`POSITION` is optional to change, although this study was performed using this fixed value.

`GEOMETRY` specifies the geometry file (e.g., 3 cm drift chamber).

`GAS_VOLUME` defines the gas mixture used (must match an entry in `Chamber_3cm.gdml`).

`PRESSURE` must match the pressure in `GAS_VOLUME`.

The line `restG4 -j 4 Isotopes_Xe_fluxes.rml -e 200000` starts the simulation:
  - `-j 4` tells Geant4 to use 4 CPU cores.
  - `Isotopes_Xe_fluxes.rml` corresponds to the detector filled with the xenon mixture and must match the mixture specified in `GAS_VOLUME`. To use the argon mixture instead, it should be replaced with `Isotopes_Ar_fluxes.rml`.
  - `-e 200000` sets the number of detected events in the Micromegas detector to 200,000.

  - ---------------------------------------------------------

Once the simulation has finished, it can be analyzed by executing `GetEfficiencyaN.C` within restRoot. Example:

```bash

restRoot

```

```bash

.x GetBinEfficiencyaN.C("RestG4_run00029_2.0bar_aN-histogram_XeNeISO_3cmDrift_v2.4.3.root", 315268, "aN3cmXenon2.0bar.root")

```

The first argument is the name of the ROOT file to analyze, the second argument (`nL`) is the number of events simulated in order to detect 200,000 events, and the third one is the name of the output histogram file.

The parameter `nL` can be obtained by opening the ROOT file and running:

```bash
xrays->GetNumberOfEvents()
```

Once the output histogram file has been created, the detection efficiency can be calculated by calling:

```bash

.x GetEfficiencyaN.C("aN3cmXenon2.0bar.root")

```
where `aN3cmXenon2.0bar.root` must match the name of the output histogram file.



## Analyzed fluxes

Once the nominal fluxes are obtained, they are used as input for the analysis. In this study, the detector’s resolution is taken into account, including the effects of electron diffusion. To run these simulations, execute `launchAna.sh`. This will generate one output file per simulation, which can be analyzed using the appropriate `GetAnalysisEfficiency.C` script located in the corresponding directory (e.g. `simFiles_aN`). 

The resulting ROOT histogram shows the detected flux after all interactions within the detector have been simulated.

### Example of use

To run a simulation, open `launchAna.sh` and edit it with the desired parameters. Example:

```bash

export NAME=aN
export PRESSURE=2.0
export DRIFT=3
filename="simFiles_${NAME}/RestG4_run00029_2.0bar_aN-histogram_XeNeISO_3cmDrift_v2.4.3.root"
if [ -f "$filename" ]; then
        # Launch restManager with the constructed filename. 
        restManager --c Ar_Analysis.rml --f "$filename" 
    else
        echo "File $filename does not exist."
    fi

```
Then, execute the script.

```bash

./launchAna.sh

```


Explanation of parameters:


`NAME` refers to the corresponding axion spectra, so that the ROOT file is generated in the appropriate directory (in this case `simFiles_aN`).

`PRESSURE` must match the pressure in `filename`.

`DRIFT` must match the drift distance in `filename`.

`MIXTURE` corresponds to `Xenon-Neon 48.85Pct-Iso 2.3Pct 10-10E3Vcm` for the Xenon mixture and `Argon-Isobutane 1Pct 10-10E3Vcm` for the Argon mixture.

`filename` is the name of the file obtained in the previous study, as it serves as input in this one.

The line `restManager --c Ar_Analysis.rml --f "$filename"` executes the analysis. There is only one file for the Argon and the Xenon mixture, which does not need to be modified.

  - ---------------------------------------------------------

Once the simulation has finished, it can be analyzed by executing `GetAnalysisEfficiencyaN.C` within restRoot. Example:

```bash

restRoot

```

```bash

.x GetAnalysisEfficiencyaN.C("Analysis_R00029_2.0bar_aN-histogram_IAXO-D1_3cmDrift_v2.4.3_signals.root","RestG4_run00029_2.0bar_aN-histogram_XeNeISO_3cmDrift_v2.4.3.root", 315268, "aN3cmXenon2.0bar.root")

```

The first argument is the name of the ROOT file to analyze, the second argument is the name of the input file (obtained in the previous study), the third one (`nL`) is the number of events simulated in order to detect 200,000 events, and the forth one is the name of the output histogram file.

The parameter `nL` can be obtained by opening the input ROOT file and running:

```bash
xrays->GetNumberOfEvents()
```

# Efficiency Study

This efficiency study is part of a research project focused on evaluating the detector's performance using different drift chambers and gas mixtures.

## Installation

Once REST-for-Physics is installed, there is no need to install any additional software. Simply download the contents of this GitHub repository, and it is ready for use.


## Intrinsic Efficiency

The aim of these simulations is to determine the detector's intrinsic efficiency in the 0â€“16 keV energy range, with 0.25 keV intervals. To run these simulations, execute `launchSim2.sh`. This will generate several output files, which can be analyzed using `getEfficiency.C` located in the `simFiles_Henke` directory. The result will be a file containing the calculated efficiency for each energy.


  ### Example of use

To run a simulation, open `launchSim2.sh` and edit it with the desired parameters. Example:

```bash

#!/bin/bash
#set -x
for N in $(seq 0.25 0.25 16.0)
do
  export GEOMETRY=Chamber_6cm.gdml
  export GAS_VOLUME=XenonNeon2.3%Isobutane2.0bar 
  export PRESSURE=2.0
  export NAME=Henke
  export POSITION=33.5
  export ENERGY="$N"

  restG4 Isotopes_Xe_fluxes.rml -e 10000
done


```
Then, execute the script.

```bash

./launchSim2.sh

```


Explanation of parameters:

The line `for N in $(seq 0.25 0.25 16.0)` defines a loop that starts at 0.25 keV and increments by 0.25 keV, ending at 16 keV.

`GEOMETRY` specifies the geometry file (e.g., 6 cm drift chamber)

`GAS_VOLUME` defines the gas mixture used (must match an entry in `Chamber_6cm.gdml`)

`PRESSURE` must match the pressure in `GAS_VOLUME`

Setting `NAME` = Henke directs the output files to the corresponding directory.

`POSITION` is optional to change, but `ENERGY` must remain fixed.

`-e 10000` sets the number of detected events in the Micromegas to 10000.

`Isotopes_Xe_fluxes.rml` corresponds to the detector filled with the xenon mixture. To use the argon mixture instead, it should be replaced with `Isotopes_Ar_fluxes.rml`

---------------------------------------------------------

Once the simulations have finished, they can be analyzed by executing `getEfficiency.C` within restRoot. Example:

```bash

restRoot

```

```bash

.x getEfficiency.C("RestG4_run*_2.0bar_Henke_XeNeISO_6cmDrift_v2.4.3")

```

This command will analyze all files whose names match the given pattern, where * acts as a wildcard.

## Nominal fluxes

The purpose of this study is to determine the detector's efficiency for different axion spectra: axion-photon, axion-electron and axion-nucleon, which can be found in the `histograms` directory. To run these simulations, execute `launchSim.sh`. This will generate one output file per simulation, which can be analyzed using the appropriate `GetEfficiency.C` script located in the corresponding directory (e.g. `simFiles_aN`). 

The result can either be a ROOT histogram representing the detected flux (e.g. when using `GetBinEfficiencyaN.C`), which can be compared to the original flux, or the calculated detection effiency (e.g. when using `GetEfficiencyaN.C`).

### Example of use

To run a simulation, open `launchSim.sh` and edit it with the desired parameters. Example:

```bash

export NAME=aN 
export RANGE="(0,16)"
export POSITION=33.5   
export GEOMETRY=Chamber_3cm.gdml 
export GAS_VOLUME=XenonNeon2.3%Isobutane2.0bar 
export PRESSURE=2.0

restG4 -j 4 Isotopes_Xe_fluxes.rml -e 200000 


```
Then, execute the script.

```bash

./launchSim.sh

```


Explanation of parameters:


`NAME` refers to the corresponding axion spectra, so that the ROOT file is generated in the appropriate directory (in this case `simFiles_aN`).

`RANGE` is the energy range in keV.

`POSITION` is optional to change, although this study was performed using this fixed value.

`GEOMETRY` specifies the geometry file (e.g., 3 cm drift chamber).

`GAS_VOLUME` defines the gas mixture used (must match an entry in `Chamber_3cm.gdml`).

`PRESSURE` must match the pressure in `GAS_VOLUME`.

The line `restG4 -j 4 Isotopes_Xe_fluxes.rml -e 200000` starts the simulation:
  - `-j 4` tells Geant4 to use 4 CPU cores.
  - `Isotopes_Xe_fluxes.rml` corresponds to the detector filled with the xenon mixture and must match the mixture specified in `GAS_VOLUME`. To use the argon mixture instead, it should be replaced with `Isotopes_Ar_fluxes.rml`.
  - `-e 200000` sets the number of detected events in the Micromegas detector to 200,000.

  - ---------------------------------------------------------

Once the simulation has finished, it can be analyzed by executing `GetEfficiencyaN.C` within restRoot. Example:

```bash

restRoot

```

```bash

.x GetBinEfficiencyaN.C("RestG4_run00029_2.0bar_aN-histogram_XeNeISO_3cmDrift_v2.4.3.root", 315268, "aN3cmXenon2.0bar.root")

```

The first argument is the name of the ROOT file to analyze, the second argument (`nL`) is the number of events simulated in order to detect 200,000 events, and the third one is the name of the output histogram file.

The parameter `nL` can be obtained by opening the ROOT file and running:

```bash
xrays->GetNumberOfEvents()
```

Once the output histogram file has been created, the detection efficiency can be calculated by calling:

```bash

.x GetEfficiencyaN.C("aN3cmXenon2.0bar.root")

```
where `aN3cmXenon2.0bar.root` must match the name of the output histogram file.
